Build a simple browser-based game called “Logic Maze”.

Tech Stack:
Use only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
Do NOT use external libraries.
Render the maze using HTML div grid (not canvas).
Keep code clean and beginner-friendly.

Game Concept:
The player must reach a goal in a maze by creating a sequence of commands.
Instead of controlling the character directly, the user builds a program using buttons.

Layout:
Left side:
- 8x8 maze grid
- Player character (colored square)
- Walls
- Goal tile (flag icon or different color)

Right side:
- Title: “Logic Maze”
- Command buttons:
   - Move Forward
   - Turn Left
   - Turn Right
- Display area showing added commands in order
- Run button
- Reset button
- Clear Commands button
- Show "Blocks Remaining: 6"

Game Rules:
- Player starts at top-left corner.
- Goal is at bottom-right.
- User can only add maximum 6 commands.
- When Run is clicked:
    - Execute commands one by one with 500ms delay
    - Update player position visually
- If player hits wall → stop execution and show "Hit a wall!"
- If player reaches goal → show "Level Complete!"
- Reset returns player to start.
- Clear Commands empties command list.

Player Logic:
Track:
- x position
- y position
- direction (up, down, left, right)

Move Forward:
- Move based on current direction.
Turn Left / Turn Right:
- Change direction properly.

Maze:
Create a simple hardcoded 2D array:
0 = empty
1 = wall
2 = goal

Styling:
- Dark background
- Maze cells square and evenly spaced
- Player = blue
- Walls = gray
- Goal = green
- Commands displayed as small colored blocks
- Clean modern UI

Code Structure:
Separate into:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js

In script.js, organize into functions:
- drawMaze()
- renderPlayer()
- addCommand()
- runProgram()
- executeCommand()
- resetGame()

Important:
- Use async/await with a sleep function for command delay.
- Make the game fully playable immediately when opened.
- Keep code well-commented.

Output:
Provide full working code for all 3 files separately.
